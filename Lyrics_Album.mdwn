## I Just Want to Sleep 

there is a hole in my soul
that I just can‘t fix 
cannot see the end of the road 
but i have to cope with it
there is more medicine 
than blood in my veins
more drugs and more alcohol
find their way 
i‘ve been talking, yeah, talking again
but i know you‘re not listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep 

I finally understand 
that i'm just so alone, what is wrong with me
Can you see me in this other world 
without the light in my heart there‘s a fire that is burning it all
i sleep for days and i hope to fade
'cause all i can hear is your heart that is screaming my name
but all my demons left this place
i just want to sleep

i just want to sleep
i am thinking too much
and my head explodes
cause i lost myself
i can‘t feel my chest

and now i‘m sitting in silence
Screaming your name with holy noise to not be afraid
and i know how high the price is
of not knowing whether i'll ever see you again
so if you're there just take my hand
so we can go down to this place where we first met
(i've) always tried to take the pain away
i just want to sleep

## Anchor

my head is empty and the walls are closing in
my face is blurry, that's all i know
that's all i know, that is all i know

and i am running and running 
yeah every single day
and you are running and running 
for feeling free
with every step that we take 
and every word that we say 
the anchor is pulling me down 
'cause i lost my way

our blurry kingdom is falling apart
in all of my dreams when the moon kissed the sun
when the moon kissed the sun, when the moon kissed the son

the anchor is pulling me down
the anchor is pulling me down
the anchor is pulling me down

and i am running and running 
yeah i am running and running 
oooaaahhh

## In Tongues

my dear friend
we didn't talk too much in the past few days
have a seat let them breathe inside of me
while i am down, laying on the ground
you will destroy my mind, my soul and my life
and i will dig holes ...

you grow like a flower to the suuun 

Take the money
And travel back to the day (when) you died
Send me postcards when you find yourself
And your empty life 
Spit on it, kill it and light it, (you) won’t regret it 
Until you stop seeing lies
Kill it, fix it, treat it, prepare for (your/the) afterlife

I don‘t care what you say about me
And I don‘t care what you think about me
I’m getting to you and figure it out
And all I can see is the tree with the rope
Your feet on the chair and your head in the loop
I’m feeling so dope while you’re bleeding it out
I’m taking your breath while I’m waiting for sound 
‘Cause I'm hunting you down, down to the ground

## Trouble Will Find Me

Trouble will find me now, one more time 
Breathe in and let me inside 
You'll let me alone in the dark when I collide 
One more time 
Breathe in and let me inside 
You'll let me alone in the dark when I collide

## Breathe Again

If I can forget my pain 
I have to learn how it starts, how it ends 
And if you try hunting me 
I don‘t feel sorry, do you feel sorry for me 

Standing on the edge, let me breathe again 
The river is awake, let me breathe again 

Let me breathe again 

If I was drowning, drowning in deep 
You‘re standing on the ship 
Watching me bleed 
And if you try hunting me 
I don‘t feel sorry, do you feel sorry for me 

Standing on the edge, let me breathe again 
The river is awake, let me breathe again 

Let me breathe again 

Standing on the edge, let me breathe again 
The river is awake, let me breathe again 
My lung’s full of water, my hands are feeling dry 
(Let me breathe again) 
We‘re drowning in circles, yeah, time after time 
(Let me breathe again)
 
You took my life You took my life

## Nightmare

My head explodes 
We‘ve seen this road 
I‘m lost and cold 
In this nightmare

I need to clear my head
Couldn‘t find any sleep in this place 
Am I pursuing this misery?
Cutting my skin to see if i still feel pain 
Falling back to my old ways 
Promise to change but i‘m not okay
I would stop thoughts of killing myself
If your indifference left, yeah, that would help 

My head explodes 
We‘ve seen this road 
I‘m lost and cold 
In this nightmare

I hope you'll never forget,  
The words that you said,  
Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm dead,  
Never asked me for a reaching hand,   
Falling back to my old ways,    
Promised to change, but I'm not okay,  
There's nothing, nothing left to say,  
Get away from me, get away from me.
Get away from me 
Just get away from me

My head explodes 
We‘ve seen this road 
I‘m lost and cold 
In this nightmare

We can‘t forget
To smile everytime we did 
We can‘t forget
To cry every time we did
