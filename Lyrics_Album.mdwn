## I Just Want to Sleep 

### Raw

there is a hole in my soul
that I just can‘t fix 
- couldn‘t see the end of the road 
without of it

there is more medicine 
than blood in my veins
more drugs and more alcohol
find their way 
- i am talking and talking again
  
but i know you're still listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep 

but when i finally understand
i never find a way to breathe
that is the way to bring your heart to bleed

and when i packed my things
you never tried to feel the same
we are running in different ways
and i asked myself about everything you wanted to be
i just stop playing these bullshit 
and i stop carrying about everything you needed from me
i never should have let you in 
i just want to sleep

i just want to sleep
i am thinking to much
i just want to sleep
cause i lost myself
i just want to sleep
and my head explore
i just want to sleep
i can feel my chest

### Structure

**Verse 1**
Something's wrong and I can't deal with it.
- problem
- and can't deal with it

**Verse 2**
I do have a problem, I realize what I can do, and this is how I deal with it.
- conscious about the problem
- reflecting about others around him
- intention to do something

**Refrain**
?
but i know you're still listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep

**Verse 3**
- what i can do
- this is how I deal with it

### V2

**Verse 1**
there is a hole in my soul
that I just can‘t fix 
- couldn‘t see the end of the road 
without of it

there is more medicine 
than blood in my veins
more drugs and more alcohol
find their way 
- i am talking and talking again
  
but i know you're still listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep 

**Verse 2**
- conscious about the problem
  - I finally understand I'm feeling so alone, what is wrong with me?
  - Can you see me here in another world, there's neither light nor soul? 
- reflecting about others around him
- intention to do something

**Refrain**
?
but i know you're still listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep

**Verse 3**
- what i can do
- this is how I deal with it


and when he packed his things
he never tried to feel the same
running away 

### V3 (30-05-2020)

**Intro**
there is a hole in my soul
that I just can‘t fix 
cannot see the end of the road 
but i have to cope with it
there is more medicine 
than blood in my veins
more drugs and more alcohol
find their way 
i've been talking, yeah, talking again
but i know you're not listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep 

**Verse**
I finally understand 
I‘m just so alone, what is wrong with me?
Can you see me in this other world 
without the light in my heart there's a fire that is burning it all
i sleep for days and i hope to fade
'cause all i can hear is your heart that is screaming my name
but all my demons left this place
i just want to sleep

**Chorus**
i just want to sleep
i am thinking too much
and my head explodes
cause i lost myself
i can't feel my chest

**Verse**
and now i'm sitting in silence
screaming your name with holy noise just to not be afraid
but now i know the price
for wanting to see you again 

of knowing how high the preis ist
of knowing i won't ever see you again 
of knowing you feel with my mistakes
of knowing i'll never find you again 
like the day you went down and prayed up in the open
like the day you were gone and everything went wrong

And now i‘m sitting in silence
Scream with holy noise your name to not be afraid
now i know how high the price is 
and i asked myself about everything i wanted to be
just stop **playing** this bullshit 
and i stop caring about everything you needed from me
now i find my way to breathe
i just want no sleep

### V4 (10-06-2020)

there is a hole in my soul
that I just can‘t fix 
cannot see the end of the road 
but i have to cope with it
there is more medicine 
than blood in my veins
more drugs and more alcohol
find their way 
i‘ve been talking, yeah, talking again
but i know you‘re not listening
why is it easy for everyone else
i just want to sleep 

I finally understand 
that i'm just so alone, what is wrong with me
Can you see me in this other world 
without the light in my heart there‘s a fire that is burning it all
i sleep for days and i hope to fade
'cause all i can hear is your heart that is screaming my name
but all my demons left this place
i just want to sleep

i just want to sleep
i am thinking too much
and my head explodes
cause i lost myself
i can‘t feel my chest

and now i‘m sitting in silence
Screaming your name with holy noise to not be afraid
and i know how high the price is
of not knowing whether i'll ever see you again
so if you're there just take my hand
so we can go down to this place where we first met
(i've) always tried to take the pain away
i just want to sleep

## Anchor

my head is empty and the walls are closing in
my face is blurry, that's all i know
that's all i know, that is all i know

and i am running and running 
yeah every single day
and you are running and running 
for feeling free
with every step that we take 
and every word that we say 
the anchor is pulling me down 
'cause i lost my way

our blurry kingdom is falling apart
in all of my dreams when the moon kissed the son
when the moon kissed the sun, when the moon kissed the son

the anchor is pulling me down
the anchor is pulling me down
the anchor is pulling me down

and i am running and running 
yeah i am running and running 
oooaaahhh

## In Tongues

my dear friend
we didn't talk too much in the past few days
have a seat let them breathe inside of me
while i am down, laying on the ground
you will destroy my mind, my soul and my life
and i will dig holes ...

you grow like a flower to the suuun 

Take the money
And travel back to the day (when) you died
Send me postcards when you find yourself
And your empty life 
Spit on it, kill it and light it, (you) won’t regret it 
Until you stop seeing lies
Kill it, fix it, treat it, prepare for (your/the) afterlife

I don‘t care what you say about me
And I don‘t care what you think about me
I’m getting to you and figure it out
And all I can see is the tree with the rope
Your feet on the chair and your head in the loop
I’m feeling so dope while you’re bleeding it out
I’m taking your breath while I’m waiting for sound 
‘Cause I'm hunting you down, down to the ground
